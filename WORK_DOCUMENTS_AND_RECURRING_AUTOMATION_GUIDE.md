# Work Documents & Recurring Period Automation - Implementation Guide

## Overview
This document describes the implementation of the Documents tab in Work Details page and the enhanced recurring period automation system.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Documents Tab in Work Details

#### Document Management Features
- **Document List Display**: View all documents associated with a work, organized by required/optional
- **Document Collection Tracking**: Mark documents as collected with timestamp
- **File Upload Support**: Upload document files (UI ready, storage integration pending)
- **Download Files**: Download uploaded documents
- **Edit Documents**: Modify document details
- **Delete Documents**: Remove documents from work
- **Visual Status Indicators**:
  - Required vs Optional badges
  - Collected status with green highlighting
  - Uploaded status with file information
  - Overdue warnings for uncollected required documents

#### Document Statistics
The tab displays three key metrics:
- **Total Documents**: Count of all documents
- **Collected**: Count of collected documents (with required document breakdown)
- **Uploaded**: Count of documents with uploaded files

#### Document Fields
Each document tracks:
- `name`: Document name
- `description`: Optional description
- `category`: Document category for organization
- `is_required`: Whether the document is mandatory
- `is_collected`: Collection status
- `file_url`: URL to uploaded file
- `file_type`: MIME type of uploaded file
- `file_size`: Size of uploaded file in bytes
- `collected_at`: Timestamp when marked as collected
- `uploaded_at`: Timestamp when file was uploaded
- `sort_order`: Display order

#### Auto-Copy from Service Documents
When a work is created for a service:
- Service documents are automatically copied to work documents
- This ensures all required documents are tracked for each work instance
- Documents can then be managed independently per work

### 2. Recurring Period Automation

#### Automatic Period Creation
**When Creating Recurring Work:**
- First period is automatically created when work is saved
- Period name, start date, end date calculated based on recurrence pattern
- Due date set according to recurrence_day field

**Automatic Next Period Generation:**
When a period's due date elapses:
- System automatically creates the next period
- Calculates correct due date based on pattern:
  - Monthly: Day X of next month
  - Quarterly: Day X of next quarter
  - Half-yearly: Day X of next half-year
  - Yearly: Day X of next year

#### Auto-Billing on Period Completion
When a recurring period is marked as "completed":
- Checks if work has `auto_bill` enabled
- Automatically generates an invoice if conditions are met
- Uses period's `billing_amount` or falls back to work's `billing_amount`
- Applies tax rate from service configuration
- Calculates due date based on service payment terms
- Marks period as `is_billed` and links to invoice
- Creates invoice with detailed line item

#### Period Lifecycle
1. **Pending**: Period is created and waiting to be worked on
2. **In Progress**: Work has started on this period
3. **Completed**: Period work is finished
   - If auto_bill enabled â†’ Invoice generated automatically
   - completed_at timestamp recorded
   - completed_by staff member tracked
4. **Next Period Created**: When due date elapses, next period auto-created

## Database Triggers

### 1. `trigger_create_initial_recurring_period`
- Fires: AFTER INSERT on works table
- Purpose: Creates the first period when a recurring work is created
- Action: Automatically inserts first period with calculated dates

### 2. `trigger_auto_generate_recurring_period_invoice`
- Fires: BEFORE UPDATE on work_recurring_instances table
- Purpose: Auto-generates invoice when period is completed
- Conditions:
  - Status changed to 'completed'
  - Not already billed
  - Work has auto_bill enabled
  - Billing amount is set
- Action: Creates invoice and invoice items, updates period with invoice_id

### 3. `create_next_recurring_period_if_needed()` Function
- Type: Manual/Scheduled function
- Purpose: Creates next periods when due dates elapse
- Should be called periodically (recommended: daily cron job)
- Checks all active recurring works and creates missing periods

## Implementation Details

### Frontend Changes

#### New Component: `DocumentsTab`
- Location: `src/components/works/WorkDetailsTabs.tsx`
- Features:
  - Document list with categorization
  - Status indicators and badges
  - Quick actions (collect, upload, edit, delete)
  - Statistics summary cards

#### Updated: `WorkDetailsMain`
- Added document state management
- Added document CRUD operations
- Integrated DocumentsTab into tab navigation
- Added document fetching in work details query

#### New Type: `WorkDocument`
- Location: `src/components/works/WorkDetailsTypes.ts`
- Complete TypeScript interface for work documents

### Database Schema

#### Tables Used
1. **service_documents**: Template documents for services
2. **work_documents**: Instance documents for each work
3. **work_recurring_instances**: Recurring period tracking
4. **works**: Work management with recurring support
5. **invoices**: Auto-generated invoices
6. **invoice_items**: Invoice line items

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Apply Database Migration
Run the SQL file `APPLY_THIS_MIGRATION.sql` in your Supabase SQL editor:
```bash
# Copy contents of APPLY_THIS_MIGRATION.sql and run in Supabase SQL Editor
```

### Step 2: Set Up Periodic Job (Optional but Recommended)
For automatic next period creation, set up a cron job or scheduled function:
```sql
-- Run this query daily to auto-create next periods
SELECT create_next_recurring_period_if_needed();
```

You can use:
- Supabase Edge Functions with cron triggers
- pg_cron extension
- External cron job calling the function via API

### Step 3: Configure Service Documents
1. Go to Services page
2. Edit a service
3. Add required documents in the Documents tab
4. These will automatically copy to works created from this service

## Usage Guide

### Managing Documents in Work Details

#### Viewing Documents
1. Open any work in the Works page
2. Click the "Documents" tab
3. View all documents with their status

#### Marking Documents as Collected
1. Click the checkmark icon on a document
2. Document will turn green and show "Collected" badge
3. Collection timestamp is automatically recorded

#### Uploading Document Files
1. Click the upload icon on a document
2. (File upload dialog will appear - storage integration pending)
3. Once uploaded, file is available for download

#### Editing Document Details
1. Click the edit icon
2. Modify document name, description, or category
3. Save changes

### Managing Recurring Periods

2. **Automatic Workflows**: Less manual work creating periods and invoices
3. **Status Visibility**: Clear view of what's collected, uploaded, or missing
4. **Audit Trail**: Timestamps for all document and period actions

### For Recurring Work
1. **Automatic Period Creation**: No manual period creation needed
2. **Auto-Billing**: Invoices generate when work is completed
3. **Continuous Tracking**: Periods auto-create when previous ones elapse
4. **Clear Period Management**: Each period is independent and trackable

## Technical Notes

### Document Storage
- File URLs are stored in database
- Actual file storage requires Supabase Storage integration
- Upload UI is ready, backend integration pending

### Performance Optimization
- Indexed queries on due_date and status
- Efficient period checks
- Batch processing for multiple works

### Security
- All operations check user authentication
- RLS policies ensure data isolation
- SECURITY DEFINER functions for system operations

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **File Storage Integration**: Connect to Supabase Storage for actual file uploads
2. **Document Templates**: Predefined document templates per service category
3. **Email Notifications**: Alert when documents are due or overdue
4. **Bulk Document Upload**: Upload multiple files at once
5. **Document Versioning**: Track document revision history
6. **Period Notifications**: Alert staff before period due dates
7. **Auto-Send Invoices**: Email invoices to customers automatically

## Troubleshooting

### Periods Not Creating Automatically
- Ensure `create_next_recurring_period_if_needed()` is being called regularly
- Check that work has `is_recurring = true` and `is_active = true`
- Verify `recurrence_pattern` and `recurrence_day` are set

### Invoices Not Generating
- Confirm work has `auto_bill = true`
- Check that period has `billing_amount` set
- Verify service has `payment_terms` and `tax_rate` configured
- Ensure period status changed to 'completed'

### Documents Not Showing
- Verify `work_documents` table has RLS policies enabled
- Check that documents were copied from service_documents
- Ensure work_id matches correctly

## Support

For issues or questions:
1. Check the database triggers are created successfully
2. Verify RLS policies are in place
3. Review error logs in Supabase Dashboard
4. Check browser console for frontend errors
