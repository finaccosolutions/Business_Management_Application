# Auto-Invoice on Task Completion - System Fixed

## Problem Summary
The system was throwing errors when updating task status to "completed":
```
Error: column "recurring_period_id" does not exist
```

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Wrong Column Names**: Triggers were referencing `recurring_period_id` instead of `work_recurring_instance_id`
2. **Duplicate Triggers**: Multiple overlapping triggers (5 different triggers) trying to do the same thing, causing conflicts
3. **Inconsistent Logic**: Different triggers had conflicting auto-invoice logic with different column references

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Removed All Duplicate Triggers
Deleted these conflicting triggers:
- `trigger_handle_period_task_update`
- `trigger_update_period_status_on_task_change`
- `trigger_track_due_date_override`
- `trigger_create_invoice_on_all_tasks_completed`
- `auto_create_invoice_on_period_complete_trigger`

### 2. Created Clean, Single-Purpose Triggers

#### Trigger 1: Track Due Date Overrides
- **Function**: `track_task_due_date_override()`
- **When**: BEFORE UPDATE on task
- **What**: Marks `is_overridden = true` when due_date is manually changed

#### Trigger 2: Update Period Status
- **Function**: `update_period_status_on_task_change()`
- **When**: AFTER INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE on task
- **What**:
  - Counts total and completed tasks
  - Updates period status (pending → in_progress → completed)
  - Sets completion timestamps
  - Updates task count fields

#### Trigger 3: Auto-Create Invoice
- **Function**: `auto_create_invoice_on_all_tasks_complete()`
- **When**: AFTER UPDATE on task (when status changes to "completed")
- **What**:
  - Checks if ALL tasks in the period are now completed
  - Verifies `work.auto_bill = true`
  - Prevents duplicate invoice creation
  - Creates invoice with correct pricing (customer_services.price OR services.default_price)
  - Links invoice to period via `work_recurring_instance_id`

### 3. Fixed All Column References
- Changed all `recurring_period_id` → `work_recurring_instance_id`
- Added `work_recurring_instance_id` column to `invoices` table
- Updated invoice lookup queries to use correct column

### 4. Proper Invoice Creation Logic
```sql
-- Uses customer-specific price if set, otherwise service default price
v_price := COALESCE(customer_services.price, services.default_price, 0)

-- Creates invoice only when:
1. ALL tasks in period are completed
2. work.auto_bill = true
3. No invoice exists for this period yet
4. invoice_generated flag is not already set
```

## How It Works Now

### When You Mark a Task as "Completed":

1. **BEFORE UPDATE Trigger** (`track_task_due_date_override`)
   - If due_date was changed, marks it as overridden

2. **AFTER UPDATE Trigger** (`update_period_status_on_task_change`)
   - Sets task `completed_at` timestamp
   - Counts all tasks and completed tasks
   - Updates period:
     - `total_tasks` and `completed_tasks`
     - `status`: "pending" → "in_progress" → "completed"
     - `all_tasks_completed`: true/false
     - `completed_at`: timestamp when last task completed

3. **AFTER UPDATE Trigger** (`auto_create_invoice_on_all_tasks_complete`)
   - Checks: Are ALL tasks completed now?
   - Checks: Is `work.auto_bill = true`?
   - Checks: Does invoice already exist?
   - If all pass: Creates invoice automatically
   - Marks period as `invoice_generated = true`

## Testing Checklist

✅ **Task Status Update**: Change task status to "completed" - NO ERRORS
✅ **Period Status Update**: Period automatically becomes "in_progress" then "completed"
✅ **Task Counts**: `total_tasks` and `completed_tasks` update correctly
✅ **Auto-Invoice**: Invoice auto-creates when:
   - All tasks completed
   - work.auto_bill = true
✅ **No Duplicates**: Invoice only created once per period
✅ **Correct Pricing**: Uses customer_services.price or services.default_price
✅ **Build Success**: `npm run build` completes without errors

## Database Cleanup Performed

1. Dropped all old conflicting trigger functions
2. Removed duplicate/conflicting triggers
3. Created 3 clean, focused triggers
4. Recalculated task counts for all existing periods
5. Verified all column references are correct

## Your Requirement: WORKING ✅

> "Auto create invoice when all tasks in a recurring work period are completed"

This now works correctly:
- Mark tasks as completed in the "Tasks" tab
- When the last task is marked "completed"
- System automatically creates invoice (if auto_bill enabled)
- Invoice appears in Invoices page with status "draft"
- Period shows as "completed" with all tasks done

## No More Errors

The error `column "recurring_period_id" does not exist` is completely fixed. All triggers now use the correct column name `work_recurring_instance_id`.
