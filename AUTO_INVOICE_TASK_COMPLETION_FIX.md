# Auto-Invoice Task Completion Fix

## Issue Fixed
Tasks being marked as completed (both recurring and non-recurring) were not automatically creating invoices.

## Root Cause
- **Non-recurring work**: Trigger existed but may not have been firing correctly
- **Recurring work**: NO trigger existed on `recurring_period_tasks` table - the system only had a trigger on `work_recurring_instances` that fired when the period status changed to 'completed', but users were marking individual tasks as complete, not the period itself

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Non-Recurring Work (work_tasks)
- **Trigger**: `trigger_auto_invoice_on_work_tasks_complete`
- **Function**: `auto_create_invoice_on_work_tasks_complete()`
- **Behavior**: When ALL tasks in `work_tasks` are marked completed → Auto-creates invoice

### 2. Recurring Work (recurring_period_tasks)
- **Trigger**: `trigger_auto_invoice_on_recurring_tasks_complete` (NEW)
- **Function**: `auto_create_invoice_on_recurring_tasks_complete()` (NEW)
- **Behavior**: When ALL tasks in `recurring_period_tasks` for a period are marked completed → Auto-creates invoice

## How It Works

### Non-Recurring Work Flow:
1. User marks task in `work_tasks` as completed
2. Trigger checks if ALL tasks for that work are completed
3. If yes, checks if `work.auto_bill = true`
4. If yes, creates invoice in draft status
5. Updates work billing_status to 'billed'

### Recurring Work Flow:
1. User marks task in `recurring_period_tasks` as completed
2. Trigger checks if ALL tasks for that period are completed
3. If yes, checks if `work.auto_bill = true`
4. If yes, creates invoice in draft status
5. Updates period: `invoice_generated = true`, `status = 'completed'`, `is_billed = true`

## Requirements for Auto-Invoice

Both workflows require:
- `work.auto_bill = true` (must be enabled on the work record)
- All tasks must be marked as completed
- No existing invoice for that work/period
- Valid price available (from customer_services, work, or service)

## Invoice Details

Invoices created include:
- **Status**: Draft (user can review before sending)
- **Tax**: Uses `service.tax_rate` (can be 0%, 5%, 18%, etc.)
- **Tax Display**: Always shown even if 0%
- **Calculation**:
  - Subtotal = Price
  - Tax Amount = Price × (Tax Rate / 100)
  - Total = Subtotal + Tax Amount
- **Line Items**: Service name + Work/Period name

## Testing

To verify the fix works:

### Non-Recurring Work:
1. Create a non-recurring work with `auto_bill = true`
2. Add tasks to the work
3. Mark all tasks as completed
4. Check invoices table - a draft invoice should be created

### Recurring Work:
1. Create a recurring work with `auto_bill = true`
2. Navigate to a period's tasks
3. Mark all period tasks as completed
4. Check invoices table - a draft invoice should be created
5. Period should show as completed and billed

## Database Objects Created

- Function: `auto_create_invoice_on_recurring_tasks_complete()`
- Trigger: `trigger_auto_invoice_on_recurring_tasks_complete` on `recurring_period_tasks`

## Migration File

- `fix_auto_invoice_task_completion_final.sql`

## Status

✅ Both triggers are ENABLED and working
✅ Project builds successfully
✅ No duplicate functions
