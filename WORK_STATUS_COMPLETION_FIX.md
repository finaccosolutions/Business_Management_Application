# Work Status and Completion Date Fix

## Problem Identified

When all tasks in a recurring work were completed:
1. Work status remained "pending" instead of updating to "completed"
2. Work completion_date was never set
3. Customer tiles showed "Pending Work 1" even though all tasks were completed
4. Work billing_status was "not_billed" even when invoice was created and sent

## Root Cause

The database was missing a trigger to update the parent `works` table status when recurring periods (`work_recurring_instances`) were completed. The system had:
- ✓ Trigger to update recurring period status when tasks completed
- ✓ Trigger to auto-create invoices when periods completed
- ✓ Trigger to update work billing_status from invoice status
- ✗ **Missing trigger to update work status from period completion**

## Solution Implemented

Created migration `20251022080000_fix_recurring_work_status_and_completion.sql` that:

1. **Added Trigger Function**: `update_work_status_from_periods()`
   - Monitors `work_recurring_instances` table for changes
   - Counts total periods and periods with all tasks completed
   - Updates parent work status to "completed" when ALL periods have all tasks done
   - Sets `completion_date` timestamp when work is marked completed
   - Reverts to "in_progress" if any period becomes incomplete

2. **Created Trigger**: `update_work_status_from_periods_trigger`
   - Fires on INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE of recurring periods
   - Watches for changes to `status` and `all_tasks_completed` columns
   - Only affects recurring works (non-recurring works have separate trigger)

3. **Fixed Existing Data**
   - Automatically updated all existing recurring works with completed periods
   - Set proper completion_date for works that should be marked completed

## Work Status Logic

### Recurring Works
- Status is determined by ALL periods having `all_tasks_completed = true`
- When all periods are complete → work status = "completed"
- If any period becomes incomplete → work status = "in_progress"

### Non-Recurring Works
- Status is determined by individual work tasks
- When all work_tasks are complete → work status = "completed"
- Handled by existing trigger `auto_update_work_status_on_task_completion()`

## Billing Status Logic

Works billing_status is automatically updated based on invoice status:
- Invoice status "draft" or "cancelled" → work billing_status = "not_billed"
- Invoice status "sent" → work billing_status = "billed"
- Invoice status "paid" → work billing_status = "paid"

## Verification Results

### Before Fix
```
work_status: "pending"
billing_status: "not_billed"
completion_date: null
total_periods: 1
periods_with_all_tasks_done: 1
```

### After Fix
```
work_status: "completed"
billing_status: "billed" (after invoice sent)
completion_date: "2025-10-22"
total_periods: 1
periods_with_all_tasks_done: 1
```

### Customer Display
- Before: "Pending Work 1"
- After: Shows correctly as completed work

## UI Display

The Work Details Overview tab already displays completion_date (line 147-150 in WorkDetailsTabs.tsx):
```tsx
{work.completion_date && (
  <div>
    <label className="text-sm font-medium text-gray-500">Completion Date</label>
    <p className="text-green-600 font-semibold mt-1 flex items-center gap-1">
      <CheckCircle size={16} />
      {new Date(work.completion_date).toLocaleDateString()}
    </p>
  </div>
)}
```

## Testing

All triggers are now working correctly:
1. ✓ Recurring period tasks completion updates period status
2. ✓ Period status completion updates work status
3. ✓ Work completion sets completion_date
4. ✓ Invoice creation/status updates work billing_status
5. ✓ Customer tiles show correct work counts
6. ✓ Works page shows correct status and billing status
7. ✓ Work details page displays completion date
