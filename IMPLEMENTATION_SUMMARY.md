# Work Management System - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented a comprehensive work management system with automatic invoice generation for completed work and enhanced recurring service support.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Database Enhancements

#### New Migration File
**File**: `supabase/migrations/20251006_enhanced_work_and_invoice_automation.sql`

**New Columns Added to `works` table:**
- `work_type`: Distinguishes regular vs recurring work
- `is_active`: Controls if recurring work should continue
- `auto_bill`: Flag to enable automatic billing on completion

**New Columns Added to `services` table:**
- `recurrence_day`: Day of month for recurring services
- `auto_generate_work`: Auto-generate work for recurring services
- `payment_terms`: Default payment terms (net_30, net_15, due_on_receipt)

**New Columns Added to `work_recurring_instances` table:**
- `invoice_id`: Links to auto-generated invoice
- `billing_amount`: Amount for this specific period
- `is_billed`: Tracks if period has been billed

**Database Functions Created:**
1. `auto_generate_work_invoice()`: Automatically creates invoice when work is completed
2. `auto_generate_recurring_period_invoice()`: Automatically creates invoice when recurring period is completed

**Triggers Created:**
1. `trigger_auto_generate_work_invoice`: Fires when work status changes to 'completed'
2. `trigger_auto_generate_recurring_period_invoice`: Fires when recurring period status changes to 'completed'

### 2. Frontend Enhancements

## Key Features

### Automatic Invoice Generation

#### For Regular Work:
1. User creates work with auto-bill enabled (default)
2. User specifies billing amount
3. When work status → 'completed':
   - System generates invoice automatically
   - Creates invoice line item
   - Updates work billing status to 'billed'
   - Calculates due date based on service payment terms

#### For Recurring Work Periods:
1. User creates recurring work
2. Adds periods with individual billing amounts
3. When period status → 'completed':
   - System checks work's auto-bill setting
   - Uses period billing amount (or falls back to work default)
   - Generates invoice for that specific period
   - Marks period as billed
   - Links invoice to period

### Enhanced Work Creation

Users can now capture:
- **Location details**: Where work will be performed
- **Department**: For organizational tracking
- **Requirements**: Specific instructions and prerequisites
- **Deliverables**: Expected outcomes
- **Auto-billing preferences**: Per-work control
- **Start dates**: For better scheduling

### Improved Recurring Work Management

**Single Work Approach:**
- One work record manages all recurring periods
- Each period tracked separately in `work_recurring_instances`
- Individual billing amounts per period
- Track completion and billing status per period
- View all periods in unified interface

**Period Management:**
- Add periods manually or automatically
- Edit period details (dates, billing amount)
- Track status per period
- Auto-generate invoices when period completes
- View invoice generation status

**Active/Inactive Control:**
- Mark recurring work as inactive to stop processing
- Historical data preserved
- No future billing for inactive work

## How It Works

### Invoice Generation Trigger Flow

```
Work Completed (status → 'completed')
    ↓
Trigger: trigger_auto_generate_work_invoice
    ↓
Check: auto_bill = true && billing_amount > 0
    ↓
Generate Invoice Number
    ↓
Get Payment Terms from Service
    ↓
Calculate Due Date
    ↓
Create Invoice Record
    ↓
Create Invoice Line Item
    ↓
Update Work: billing_status = 'billed'
```

### Recurring Period Invoice Flow

```
Period Completed (status → 'completed')
    ↓
Trigger: trigger_auto_generate_recurring_period_invoice
    ↓
Get Work & Service Info
    ↓
Determine Billing Amount:
  - Period amount (if specified)
  - OR Work default amount
  - OR Service default price
    ↓
Check: work.auto_bill = true
    ↓
Generate Invoice
    ↓
Create Invoice Line Item
    ↓
Update Period: is_billed = true, invoice_id = <id>
```

## Data Flow

### Work Creation Flow
1. User selects service
2. System auto-fills:
   - Billing amount (from service default_price)
   - Due date calculation basis (from payment_terms)
   - Recurrence settings (if service is recurring)
3. User provides additional details
4. Work created with auto_bill enabled by default

### Recurring Period Flow
1. User creates recurring work
2. User adds periods (manually or scheduled)
3. Each period tracks:
   - Period dates
   - Billing amount (can override work default)
   - Status
   - Invoice generation status
4. When period completes:
   - Invoice auto-generated (if enabled)
   - Period marked as billed
   - Invoice linked to period

## Payment Terms Integration

Services now support payment terms that control invoice due dates:
- **net_15**: Invoice due 15 days from completion
- **net_30**: Invoice due 30 days from completion (default)
- **due_on_receipt**: Invoice due immediately

These automatically calculate due dates when invoices are generated.

## Migration Steps

### To Enable This Feature:

1. **Run Database Migration**
   ```sql
   -- Run: supabase/migrations/20251006_enhanced_work_and_invoice_automation.sql
   -- This creates new columns, functions, and triggers
   ```

2. **Verify Triggers**
   ```sql
   -- Check triggers are installed
   SELECT * FROM pg_trigger WHERE tgname LIKE 'trigger_auto_generate%';
   ```

3. **Test Invoice Generation**
   - Create a test work with billing amount
   - Enable auto-bill
   - Mark work as completed
   - Verify invoice appears in Invoices section

4. **Test Recurring Work**
   - Create recurring work
   - Add a test period with billing amount
   - Mark period as completed
   - Verify invoice generated and linked

## Notes for Supabase Setup

⚠️ **Important**: The migration file is saved locally but needs to be applied manually when Supabase becomes available. The region was temporarily unavailable during implementation.

To apply when ready:
1. Access Supabase dashboard
2. Navigate to SQL Editor
3. Run the migration file: `20251006_enhanced_work_and_invoice_automation.sql`
4. Verify all tables, columns, functions, and triggers created successfully

## Future Enhancements

Potential additions:
- Automatic period generation based on recurrence pattern
- Email notifications when invoices are auto-generated
- Batch invoice generation for multiple periods
- Revenue forecasting for recurring work
- Customer-specific payment terms
- Work templates for frequently repeated work
- Integration with accounting systems
