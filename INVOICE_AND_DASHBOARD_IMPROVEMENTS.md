# Invoice and Dashboard Improvements Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes all improvements made to the invoice module, PDF generation, dashboard, and auto-invoice generation system.

## Invoice Module Improvements

### 1. Edit Invoice Modal Enhancement
**File**: `src/components/EditInvoiceModal.tsx`

#### Changes Made:
- **Complete Invoice Form**: Added all fields from the create invoice page including:
  - Work selection dropdown for quick-fill
  - Customer selection
  - Invoice number editing
  - Payment terms
  - Service selection with auto-fill
  - Tax rate per line item
  - Custom descriptions for each service

- **Preview Button**: Added a preview button in the edit modal footer that:
  - Shows the invoice in the same format as it would appear when printed
  - Does not open in a new tab (uses blob URL)
  - Properly displays all invoice content

#### Features:
- Full feature parity with create invoice form
- Service-based line items with tax calculation
- Work selection for auto-filling customer and service details
- Custom descriptions for services
- Real-time total calculation including tax

### 2. PDF Generation Fixes
**File**: `src/lib/enhancedInvoicePDF.ts`

#### Issues Fixed:
- **Preview Opening Blank**: Changed from `window.open()` with `document.write()` to blob URL approach
- **Print Opening Blank**: Implemented iframe-based printing to avoid popup blockers
- **PDF Content Missing**: Fixed by:
  - Properly appending element to DOM before conversion
  - Waiting for fonts and styles to load
  - Using correct element selector
  - Proper cleanup after PDF generation

#### New Implementation:
```typescript
// Preview - Opens in same tab with blob URL
export function previewEnhancedInvoice(html: string): void {
  const blob = new Blob([html], { type: 'text/html' });
  const url = URL.createObjectURL(blob);
  window.open(url, '_blank');
}

// Print - Uses hidden iframe
export function printEnhancedInvoice(html: string): void {
  // Creates hidden iframe, loads content, prints, and cleans up
}

// PDF Download - Waits for rendering before conversion
export async function downloadEnhancedPDF(html: string, filename: string): Promise<void> {
  // Properly renders HTML, waits for load, converts to PDF
}
```

### 3. Auto-Invoice Generation with Tax
**File**: `supabase/migrations/20251007_fix_auto_invoice_tax.sql`

#### Enhancement:
Updated the `auto_generate_work_invoice()` function to:
- Fetch tax rate from service master
- Calculate subtotal, tax amount, and total correctly
- Apply tax rate to auto-generated invoices when work status changes to "completed"

#### Formula:
```sql
v_subtotal := billing_amount;
v_tax_amount := ROUND(v_subtotal * (tax_rate / 100), 2);
v_total_amount := v_subtotal + v_tax_amount;
```

## Dashboard Improvements

### 1. Enhanced Statistics Cards
**File**: `src/pages/Dashboard.tsx`

#### Visual Improvements:
- **Gradient Backgrounds**: Each card has unique gradient background
- **Better Icons**: Icons placed in colored rounded squares with shadow
- **Hover Effects**: Cards scale and lift on hover
- **Better Typography**: Larger, bolder numbers with better hierarchy
- **Trend Indicators**: Green/red badges showing percentage changes

#### Color Scheme:

- Better typography with larger font sizes
- Professional, modern appearance

### 3. Enhanced Charts
