# Invoice Ledger Display and Status Reversal Fix

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Voucher Number Display
**Problem**: Invoice ledger entries showed "N/A" in the voucher number column instead of the actual invoice number.

**Solution**: Added `invoice_number` column to `ledger_transactions` table to properly track invoice-related entries.

### 2. Particulars Display
**Problem**: Ledger entries for invoices showed generic text like "Invoice INV-00001 - Customer receivable" instead of the actual ledger account name (e.g., "Sales Revenue" or customer name).

**Solution**: Updated the frontend logic to fetch and display the opposite account name in the Particulars column for both regular vouchers and invoice entries.

### 3. Status Reversal (Draft Deletion)
**Problem**: When an invoice status was changed from "sent" or "paid" back to "draft", the ledger entries remained, causing incorrect account balances.

**Solution**: Enhanced the `handle_invoice_status_change()` trigger function to aggressively remove ALL posted ledger entries when status changes to draft.

## Changes Made

### Database Changes

#### 1. Added `invoice_number` Column
```sql
ALTER TABLE ledger_transactions
ADD COLUMN invoice_number TEXT;
```

This column stores the invoice number for invoice-related ledger entries, enabling:
- Proper voucher number display in ledger reports
- Easy identification and filtering of invoice entries
- Reliable reversal when status changes to draft

#### 2. Updated Existing Entries
All existing invoice ledger entries were updated with their invoice numbers extracted from the narration field.

#### 3. Created Index
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_ledger_transactions_invoice_number
ON ledger_transactions(invoice_number)
WHERE invoice_number IS NOT NULL;
```

#### 4. Enhanced Trigger Function
The `handle_invoice_status_change()` function now:

**Status → Draft (REVERSAL)**:
- Deletes ALL receipt vouchers linked to the invoice
- Deletes invoice ledger entries using invoice_number (most reliable)
- Fallback deletion using narration pattern (for old entries)
- Final cleanup using account_id + date (safety net)

**Status → Sent/Paid (POSTING)**:
- Posts BOTH ledger entries (double-entry bookkeeping)
- Sets `invoice_number` on both entries for proper display
- Checks for existing entries using invoice_number

**Status → Paid**:
- Creates receipt voucher with proper ledger entries
- Links receipt to invoice via `invoice_id`

### Frontend Changes

#### Updated Ledger.tsx

**1. Enhanced `fetchLedgerEntries()` Function**:
```typescript
// Handle regular voucher entries
if (txn.vouchers?.id) {
  voucherNumber = txn.vouchers.voucher_number;
  voucherType = txn.vouchers.voucher_types?.name || 'Voucher';
  // Fetch opposite account name for Particulars
}
// Handle invoice entries (voucher_id is NULL but invoice_number exists)
else if (txn.invoice_number) {
  voucherNumber = txn.invoice_number;  // ✓ Shows invoice number
  voucherType = 'Invoice';
  // Fetch opposite account name for Particulars
}
```

**2. Enhanced `handleTransactionClick()` Function**:
```typescript
// Handle invoice entries (click to view invoice)
if (entry.voucher_type_code === 'ITMINV' && typeof entry.voucher_id === 'string') {
  // Fetch invoice by invoice_number and show invoice modal
}
// Handle receipt vouchers linked to invoices
if (voucherData.invoice_id) {
  // Fetch linked invoice and show invoice modal
}
```

## Results

### Before Fix
- **Voucher Number**: "N/A"
- **Voucher Type**: "Unknown"
- **Particulars**: "Invoice INV-00001 - Customer receivable"
- **Status Reversal**: Ledger entries remained when changing to draft

### After Fix
- **Voucher Number**: "INV-00001" (actual invoice number)
- **Voucher Type**: "Invoice"
- **Particulars**: "Sales Revenue" or "ABC Customer" (actual ledger account name)
- **Status Reversal**: ALL ledger entries properly removed when changing to draft

## Testing Scenarios

### 1. Invoice Status: Draft → Sent
- ✓ Posts TWO ledger entries with invoice_number
- ✓ Debit: Customer Account (Accounts Receivable)
- ✓ Credit: Income Account (Revenue)

### 2. Invoice Status: Sent → Draft (REVERSAL)
- ✓ Removes BOTH ledger entries using invoice_number
- ✓ Removes any associated receipt vouchers
- ✓ Account balances return to pre-invoice state

### 3. Invoice Status: Sent → Paid
- ✓ Creates receipt voucher
- ✓ Posts receipt to ledger (Debit: Cash/Bank, Credit: Customer)
- ✓ Links receipt to invoice

### 4. Invoice Status: Paid → Draft (FULL REVERSAL)
- ✓ Removes receipt voucher and its ledger entries
- ✓ Removes invoice ledger entries
- ✓ Complete reversal of all accounting effects

### 5. Ledger Display
- ✓ Invoice entries show actual invoice number
- ✓ Particulars show opposite account name
- ✓ Clicking invoice entry opens invoice modal
- ✓ Clicking receipt entry opens invoice modal (if linked)
