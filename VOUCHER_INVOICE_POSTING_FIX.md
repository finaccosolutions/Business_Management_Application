# Voucher & Invoice Posting System - Complete Fix

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Vouchers Not Posting to Ledger
**Problem**: When creating vouchers (Payment, Receipt, Journal, Contra) and changing status to "posted", the entries were not being posted to `ledger_transactions` table.

**Solution**: Implemented `handle_voucher_status_change()` trigger that:
- Automatically posts all voucher entries to ledger when status changes to "posted"
- Prevents duplicate postings by checking if already posted
- Creates proper debit/credit entries in ledger_transactions

### 2. Invoice Status "Paid" Not Creating Receipt Voucher
**Problem**: When marking an invoice as "paid", it should automatically create a receipt voucher but wasn't working properly.

**Solution**: Enhanced `handle_invoice_status_change()` to:
- Auto-create receipt voucher when invoice status changes to "paid"
- Properly map customer account (uses customer.account_id or invoice.customer_account_id)
- Update customer record with account_id if missing
- Use configured cash/bank ledger from company settings
- Create proper receipt voucher entries (Dr. Cash/Bank, Cr. Customer)
- Include customer name in narration for clarity

### 3. Status Changes to Draft Not Deleting Ledger Entries
**Problem**: When changing voucher/invoice status back to "draft", the posted ledger entries were not being deleted.

**Solution**: Implemented comprehensive cleanup:
- **Vouchers**: When status changes to "draft", deletes all related ledger entries
- **Invoices**: When status changes to "draft", deletes:
  - Invoice ledger entries
  - Any receipt vouchers created for that invoice
  - Receipt voucher ledger entries

### 4. Invoice Status Change from "Paid" Not Deleting Receipt
**Problem**: When changing invoice status from "paid" to another status, the auto-created receipt voucher was not being deleted.

**Solution**: When invoice status changes FROM "paid":
- Finds all receipt vouchers linked to that invoice
- Deletes receipt voucher ledger entries
- Deletes receipt voucher entries
- Deletes the receipt voucher itself

### 5. Voucher Status Management
**Problem**: Inconsistent behavior when changing voucher status between draft/posted/cancelled.

**Solution**: Complete status transition handling:
- `draft → posted`: Posts to ledger
- `posted → draft`: Deletes from ledger
- `posted → cancelled`: Deletes from ledger
- `any → cancelled`: Deletes from ledger

## Status Transition Matrix

### Vouchers
| From Status | To Status  | Action                                    |
|------------|-----------|-------------------------------------------|
| draft      | posted    | Create ledger entries                     |
| posted     | draft     | Delete ledger entries                     |
| posted     | cancelled | Delete ledger entries                     |
| any        | cancelled | Delete ledger entries                     |

### Invoices
| From Status | To Status  | Action                                           |
|------------|-----------|--------------------------------------------------|
| draft      | sent/any  | Post to ledger (Dr. Customer, Cr. Income)       |
| sent/any   | draft     | Delete invoice ledger + receipt voucher + ledger|
| any        | paid      | Create receipt voucher (Dr. Cash, Cr. Customer) |
| paid       | any       | Delete receipt voucher + ledger                 |
| any        | cancelled | Delete all related entries                      |

## Database Changes

### New Triggers
1. `trigger_handle_voucher_status_change` - Manages voucher posting/unposting
2. `trigger_handle_invoice_status_change` - Manages invoice posting and receipt creation

### New Functions
1. `handle_voucher_status_change()` - Voucher status transition handler
2. `handle_invoice_status_change()` - Invoice status transition handler with receipt auto-creation

### Schema Updates
- Added `invoice_id` column to `vouchers` table (if not exists)
- Added index on `vouchers.invoice_id` for performance

## How It Works

### Voucher Posting Flow
1. User creates voucher in "draft" status with entries
2. User changes status to "posted"
3. Trigger automatically:
   - Checks for duplicate posting
   - Creates ledger entries from voucher_entries
   - Posts to ledger_transactions with proper debit/credit

### Invoice Payment Flow
1. User creates invoice and changes status to "sent"
2. Trigger posts invoice to ledger (Dr. Customer, Cr. Income)
3. User marks invoice as "paid"
4. Trigger automatically:
   - Gets company settings for cash/bank preference
   - Gets customer account mapping
   - Creates receipt voucher with auto-generated number
   - Creates receipt entries (Dr. Cash/Bank, Cr. Customer)
   - Sets receipt status to "posted"
   - Receipt posting trigger creates ledger entries

### Reversal Flow
1. If voucher status changes to "draft" → Deletes ledger entries
2. If invoice status changes to "draft" → Deletes invoice ledger + receipt voucher + receipt ledger
3. If invoice status changes from "paid" to "sent" → Deletes receipt voucher only

## Configuration Required

For automatic receipt creation to work, ensure:
1. Company settings configured with:
   - `default_cash_ledger_id` or `default_bank_ledger_id`
   - `default_payment_receipt_type` (cash/bank)
   - `receipt_prefix` (e.g., "RV-")

2. Receipt voucher type exists with code "ITMRCT", "RV", or "RECEIPT"

3. Customers have `account_id` mapped (or system will use invoice's customer_account_id)

## Testing Checklist

### Vouchers
- [ ] Create payment voucher, change to posted → Check ledger entries created
- [ ] Change posted voucher to draft → Check ledger entries deleted
- [ ] Create receipt voucher, change to posted → Check ledger entries created
- [ ] Change posted voucher to cancelled → Check ledger entries deleted

### Invoices
- [ ] Create invoice, change to sent → Check invoice ledger entries created
- [ ] Change sent invoice to draft → Check invoice ledger deleted
- [ ] Change invoice to paid → Check receipt voucher auto-created
- [ ] Check receipt voucher has proper entries and customer name
- [ ] Check receipt voucher is posted to ledger
- [ ] Change paid invoice to sent → Check receipt voucher deleted
- [ ] Change paid invoice to draft → Check both invoice and receipt deleted

### Reports
- [ ] Verify ledger balances are correct
- [ ] Verify trial balance is balanced
- [ ] Verify customer account shows proper receivables
- [ ] Verify cash/bank account shows proper receipts

## Notes

- All triggers prevent duplicate postings by checking existing entries
- Customer account mapping is automatically handled
- Receipt vouchers are linked to invoices via `invoice_id` for tracking
- All deletions are cascaded properly to maintain data integrity
- Account balances are automatically recalculated after migration
