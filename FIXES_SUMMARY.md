# Voucher and Invoice Status Management Fixes

## Overview
This document summarizes all the fixes implemented to resolve issues with voucher and invoice management, including button functionality, edit capabilities, and automatic status-based operations.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Voucher Button Functionality
**Problem**: View, Edit, Print buttons on voucher tiles were not functioning properly.

**Solution**:
- All button handlers (`onView`, `onEdit`, `onPost`, `onPrint`, `onCancel`, `onDelete`) are properly connected and functional
- Each button triggers the appropriate action with proper data fetching and state management

### 2. Voucher Edit Functionality
**Problem**: When clicking Edit button, the modal would open but saved ledgers and amounts were not displayed.

**Solution**:
- Enhanced `PaymentVoucherModal` and `ReceiptVoucherModal` to accept an optional `editVoucher` prop
- Added logic to load existing voucher entries when editing
- Properly populates form fields and ledger entries from the existing voucher data
- Update vs Create logic implemented - updates existing voucher or creates new one

**Files Modified**:
- `src/components/accounting/PaymentVoucherModal.tsx`
- `src/components/accounting/ReceiptVoucherModal.tsx`
- `src/pages/Vouchers.tsx`

**Key Changes**:
```typescript
interface PaymentVoucherModalProps {
  onClose: () => void;
  voucherTypeId: string;
  editVoucher?: Voucher; // New optional prop
}

// In handleEdit function
const handleEdit = async (voucher: Voucher) => {
  // Fetch voucher entries with full details
  const { data: entries, error } = await supabase
    .from('voucher_entries')
    .select('*')
    .eq('voucher_id', voucher.id);

  // Pass voucher with entries to modal
  setSelectedVoucher({ ...voucher, voucher_entries: entries });
  setShowModal(true);
};
```

### 3. Invoice Status "Paid" Auto-Creates Receipt Voucher
**Problem**: When invoice status was changed to "paid", a receipt voucher was not being created automatically.

**Solution**:
- Enhanced database trigger `handle_invoice_status_change()` in migration file
- Automatically creates a receipt voucher when invoice status changes to "paid"
- Properly maps customer account and cash/bank ledger
- Creates both voucher and voucher_entries records
- Sets receipt voucher status to "posted" automatically

**Database Migration**: `20251019130001_fix_voucher_edit_and_status_management.sql`

**Key Features**:
- Detects cash vs bank based on company settings (`default_payment_receipt_type`)
- Uses proper customer account mapping from invoice or customer record
- Creates proper double-entry: Debit Cash/Bank, Credit Customer Account
- Prevents duplicate receipt vouchers for same invoice
- Includes detailed logging for troubleshooting

### 4. Status Change Cleanup System
**Problem**:
- When invoice status changed from "sent" or "paid" to "draft", ledger entries were not deleted
- When invoice status changed from "paid" to other status, the receipt voucher was not deleted

**Solution**:
Implemented comprehensive status transition handling:

#### Voucher Status Transitions:
- **TO "posted"**: Posts entries to `ledger_transactions`
- **FROM "posted" TO "draft"**: Deletes all ledger entries
- **FROM "posted" TO "cancelled"**: Deletes all ledger entries

#### Invoice Status Transitions:
- **TO non-draft** (sent, paid, overdue): Posts to `ledger_transactions`
- **FROM non-draft TO "draft"**: Deletes invoice ledger entries
- **TO "paid"**: Creates receipt voucher (posted status)
- **FROM "paid" TO anything else**: Deletes receipt voucher AND its ledger entries
- **TO "cancelled"**: Deletes all related entries and vouchers

**Database Trigger**: `trigger_handle_invoice_status_change`

## Database Schema Changes

### Enhanced Trigger Function
The `handle_invoice_status_change()` function now handles:

1. **Draft → Sent/Paid/Overdue**: Post invoice to ledger
2. **Any → Draft**: Remove ledger entries (clean slate)
3. **Any → Paid**: Create receipt voucher automatically
4. **Paid → Any**: Delete receipt voucher and its entries
5. **Any → Cancelled**: Full cleanup of all related records

### Ledger Posting Logic

**Invoice Posting** (when status != draft):
```sql
-- Debit: Customer Account (Accounts Receivable)
INSERT INTO ledger_transactions (account_id, debit, credit, narration)
VALUES (invoice.customer_account_id, invoice.total_amount, 0, 'Customer receivable');

-- Credit: Income Account (Revenue)
INSERT INTO ledger_transactions (account_id, debit, credit, narration)
VALUES (invoice.income_account_id, 0, invoice.total_amount, 'Service income');
```

**Receipt Voucher Posting** (when invoice status = paid):
```sql
-- Debit: Cash/Bank (money coming in)
INSERT INTO voucher_entries (account_id, debit_amount, credit_amount)
VALUES (cash_bank_ledger_id, total_amount, 0);

-- Credit: Customer Account (reducing receivable)
INSERT INTO voucher_entries (account_id, debit_amount, credit_amount)
VALUES (customer.account_id, 0, total_amount);
```

## Testing Checklist

To verify all fixes are working:

### Voucher Management
- [ ] Create a new payment voucher
- [ ] Edit the payment voucher - verify ledgers and amounts load
- [ ] Change voucher status from draft to posted - verify ledger entries created
- [ ] Change voucher status from posted to draft - verify ledger entries deleted
- [ ] View voucher details
- [ ] Print voucher
- [ ] Delete voucher

### Invoice Management
- [ ] Create a new invoice
- [ ] Change invoice status from draft to sent - verify ledger posting
- [ ] Change invoice status from sent to draft - verify ledger entries deleted
- [ ] Change invoice status from draft to paid - verify:
  - Receipt voucher auto-created
  - Receipt voucher status is "posted"
  - Customer account properly mapped
  - Cash/Bank ledger properly used
- [ ] Change invoice status from paid to sent - verify:
  - Receipt voucher deleted
  - Receipt voucher ledger entries deleted
- [ ] Edit invoice and verify changes save
- [ ] Delete invoice

### Edge Cases
- [ ] Customer without account_id mapping - verify proper warning
- [ ] No cash/bank ledger configured - verify proper error handling
- [ ] Duplicate receipt voucher prevention - change to paid twice
- [ ] Status change while voucher/ledger entries exist

## Files Modified

1. **Frontend Components**:
   - `src/components/accounting/PaymentVoucherModal.tsx` - Added edit support
   - `src/components/accounting/ReceiptVoucherModal.tsx` - Added edit support
   - `src/pages/Vouchers.tsx` - Enhanced edit handler with entry fetching

2. **Database Migrations**:
   - `supabase/migrations/20251019130001_fix_voucher_edit_and_status_management.sql`

## Deployment Notes

1. Apply the database migration first:
   ```bash
   supabase db reset --linked
   ```

2. The frontend changes are backward compatible and can be deployed immediately

3. Existing vouchers and invoices will work with the new system

4. Account balances will be automatically recalculated after migration

## Known Limitations

1. Receipt vouchers are automatically created only for paid invoices (by design)
2. If customer doesn't have account_id, the invoice's customer_account_id will be used and updated to customer record
3. Cash vs Bank selection is based on company settings, not per-transaction

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for consideration:
1. Allow user to select cash/bank when marking invoice as paid
2. Add bulk status change operations
3. Add audit trail for status changes
4. Email notifications on status changes
5. Approval workflow for voucher posting
